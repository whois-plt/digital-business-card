        I really love music. I work out with music, I work with music, I read with music, I sleep with music and I
        couldn't imagine driving a car without music (think I didn't miss anythingðŸ˜„). I was also a drummer for quite a
        few years, but that was a long time ago. Perhaps will do some more in the future.
        <br />
        <br />A few other things besides music: hiking, cooking, working out (mostly weight-lifting or calisthenics),
        and smoking high-quality cigars.
